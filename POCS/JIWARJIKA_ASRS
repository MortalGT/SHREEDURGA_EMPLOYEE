ASRS – SAP Integration
Palletization Process – Assumptions & Interfaces
________________________________________
1. Assumptions
1.	Communication between AD-WCS and the SAP system of JIWARAJKA TEXTILE INDUSTRIES will take place via REST APIs.
2.	Pallet barcodes and carton barcodes must:
o	Be unique
o	Follow a predefined format
o	Have a maximum length of 14 characters
3.	The JT team will add a predefined prefix to every pallet barcode to identify pallet type:
o	IDY
o	FDY
o	DTY
o	POY
4.	Printing of pallet barcodes and carton barcodes is already available and operational at the client location and is out of scope for the ASRS–SAP integration.________________________________________
2. Palletization Process Flow
•	Material is packed into cartons at production.
•	Carton barcodes are generated and printed.
•	Operator performs palletization by grouping cartons.
•	A pallet barcode is assigned and affixed.

Carton Production Header
Field Name	Description	Data Type / Length
SKU	Material / SKU code	String (15)
Batch	Lot Number + Grade	String (15)
Pack Type	Box / Wooden Pallet	String (20)

Functional Notes
•	One batch may contain multiple carton barcodes.
•	Each carton barcode is unique across the plant.
________________________________________
5. Palletization Confirmation Interface
AD-WCS ➜ SAP
Purpose
To confirm palletization completion and establish carton-to-pallet linkage.
Endpoint
•	Created by: SAP
•	Consumed by: AD-WCS
Fields Provided
Field Name	Description	Data Type / Length
Pallet Barcode	Unique pallet identifier with prefix	String (15)
Carton Barcodes	List of carton barcodes mapped to pallet	Array of Strings


Store-In Process Flow
Store-In Confirmation – AD-WCS ➜ SAP
Trigger
After successful physical storage of the pallet in ASRS.
Process Description
AD-WCS sends Store-In confirmation data to SAP via REST API.
Data Sent to SAP
•	Pallet Barcode
•	Carton Barcodes
•	SKU
•	Batch
•	Quantity
•	Rack Location (ASRS location)
________________________________________
Clarifications Required from Client – Store-In Logic
1.	ASRS Location Handling in SAP
o	Are ASRS rack/bin locations already created in SAP?
o	If yes:
	Are these locations mapped to a specific storage type / storage section?
o	If no:
	Should all pallets be posted to a single/common storage location (e.g., “ASRS”) in SAP?
2.	Stock Posting / Movement in SAP
o	On Store-In confirmation, should SAP:
	Perform a stock transfer from staging location to ASRS location?
	Or only update pallet/location reference without physical stock movement?
o	Which movement type is expected (if any)?
3.	Downstream Process Usage
o	Client to confirm how Store-In confirmation data will be used in SAP.
________________________________________
Step 11: QC Status Handling (Reporting Only)
QC Status Update – SAP ➜ AD-WCS
Purpose
To provide QC status visibility for materials stored in ASRS.
No operational blocking logic will be handled in AD-WCS.
Data Sent by SAP
•	SKU
•	Production Date
•	QC Status
•	QC Status Reason
________________________________________
Clarifications Required from Client – QC Process
1.	Timing of Inspection
o	At what stage does QC inspection take place?
	Before palletization?
	After palletization but before ASRS Store-In?
	After Store-In inside ASRS?
________________________________________
QC Reporting Note
•	QC status received in AD-WCS will be used only for reporting and visibility purposes.




AD-WCS ➜ SAP
Trigger
This action is triggered once the pallet is successfully stored in the ASRS.
Process Description
AD-WCS calls the SAP endpoint to update SAP with final storage details of the pallet.
Endpoint Details
•	Endpoint Created by: SAP (SAP exposes the API for receiving pallet storage details)
•	Consumer of Endpoint: AD-WCS
Fields Sent to SAP
Field Name	Description	Data Type / Length
Pallet Barcode	Unique pallet identifier	String (15)
SKU	Material / SKU code	String (15)
Rack Location	ASRS rack/bin location where pallet is stored	String (20)
Carton Barcodes	List of carton barcodes stored on the pallet	Array of Strings (15)
Functional Notes
•	One pallet barcode can be linked to multiple carton barcodes.
•	Rack location refers to the physical ASRS coordinate provided by AD-WCS.
________________________________________
Quality Status Update
SAP ➜ AD-WCS
Trigger
This action is triggered from SAP after the material has been stored in ASRS.
Process Description
SAP sends QC status information to AD-WCS.
AD-WCS will only display this information in reports and will not perform any operational action based on QC status.
Endpoint Details
•	Endpoint Created by: AD-WCS (provides the API endpoint)
•	Consumer of Endpoint: SAP

QC Reason	Reason for QC status	String (100)

Functional Notes
•	QC status is informational only for AD-WCS.
•	No blocking, movement restriction, or control logic will be implemented in AD-WCS based on QC status.

Store-Out Process – Design Flow (Main Points)
1.	Store-Out Cockpit in SAP
o	Custom cockpit to view batch-wise stock from ASRS
o	User selects probable pallets & batches for dispatch
2.	Outbound Delivery Creation
o	Delivery created in SAP without batch split
o	Quantity maintained at item level only
3.	SAP → AD-WCS Communication
o	SAP sends delivery + probable pallet & batch details to ASRS
4.	Physical Picking in ASRS
o	ASRS removes actual pallets & batches
o	Actual picked stock may differ from probable selection
5.	AD-WCS → SAP Confirmation
o	ASRS sends actual pallet & batch details to SAP via API
6.	Delivery Update & PGI in SAP
o	SAP updates delivery with actual batch split
o	Pallet details updated
o	PGI triggered
