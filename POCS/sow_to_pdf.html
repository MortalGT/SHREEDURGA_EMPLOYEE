## 2. INTRODUCTION & CONTEXT

Baramati Agro operates a complex distribution ecosystem involving franchises, owned stores, sales teams, factories, logistics partners, and end customers. Current operations require tighter control, improved visibility, reduced manual intervention, and stronger integration with SAP to ensure financial and inventory accuracy.

This Statement of Work defines the scope for designing, engineering, integrating, testing, and deploying a unified digital platform that enables Baramati Agro to manage franchise ordering, billing, inventory movement, delivery confirmation, secondary sales, and reporting, with SAP ECC6 acting as the system of record.

---

## 3. OBJECTIVES OF THE ENGAGEMENT

The objectives of this engagement are as follows:

- Digitise franchise and owned-store operations end-to-end
- Ensure all inventory movements are reflected accurately in SAP
- Enforce payment discipline across all applicable sales flows
- Provide real-time visibility to sales, factory, logistics, and management teams
- Reduce manual errors and reconciliation effort
- Establish a scalable platform capable of supporting future growth

---

## 4. Functional Discussion

> Note:
> Any section marked as **“Discussion Required”** indicates dependency on business / SAP / operations sign-off.
> Absence of a final decision shall not be treated as a product or delivery gap.

---

### 4.1. Outlet / Dealer Types

#### 4.1.1 Franchise Store
- Independently owned
- Uses Franchise App
- Procures stock from Baramati

**Capabilities**
- Place primary orders
- Accept delivery & GRN
- Perform secondary billing
- Accept customer payments

**Discussion Required**
- Final list of franchise roles and permissions (Owner vs Staff)
- Whether partial GRN is allowed or strictly full GRN
	- internal comment (makrand): partial grn and balance will be treated as shrinkage/credit note.
- Whether franchise credit is allowed in future (currently assumed NO)

---

#### 4.1.2 Baramati Owned Store
- Owned by Baramati
- Stock movement is internal

**Capabilities**
- Raise stock requests
- Perform internal transfers (STO)
- Perform secondary billing
- No primary payment flow

##### Internal Transfer
- Internal Transfer refers to stock transfer between the company and its own stores.
This will be treated as an internal stock movement and no external customer or third party is involved in this process.

##### Customer Payment to Baramati
- End customers will make the payment directly at the Application.
- No payment request or payment initiation will be triggered from SAP.
- SAP will only capture the sales transaction data for accounting and reporting purpose.

**Discussion Required**
- Identification logic of “Baramati Owned Store” (flag in SAP / backend)
- Whether owned stores can ever convert STO → SO (future)
- Whether owned store secondary billing follows exact franchise rules or separate policy

---

#### 4.1.3 Distributor / Stockist (Edge Case)
- Used only for stock procurement
- No billing responsibility

**Capabilities**
- Manual stock adjustment only
- Only Baramati SKUs allowed

**Explicit Out of Scope**
- Distributor billing workflows
- Distributor payment tracking
- Distributor reconciliation

> This flow is informational and stock-only.  
> No automation commitment is assumed.

#### 4.1.4 Material Types
Following material types are considered as part of scope:
a. Baramati Stock
b. Third-Party Stock (e.g. Coke)
GRN will be created only for Baramati stock for inventory tracking in SAP.
GRN creation for third-party stock will not be required in SAP.

---

---
